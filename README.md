# Pacman Game - University Mini Project

A classic Pacman game implementation using Python and Pygame, developed as a university mini project to demonstrate game development concepts, object-oriented programming, and real-time game mechanics.

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.7 or higher
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Play

1. Run the game:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. Controls:
   - Arrow keys or WASD to move Pacman
   - ESC to quit
   - SPACE to pause/unpause

## Game Features

- Classic Pacman gameplay
- Ghost AI with different behaviors
- Pellets and power pellets
- Score tracking
- Multiple levels
- Sound effects

## Game Rules

- Collect all pellets to advance to the next level
- Avoid ghosts or you lose a life
- Eat power pellets to temporarily make ghosts vulnerable
- Earn points by eating pellets, power pellets, and ghosts

## Project Information

This project was developed as a university mini project to demonstrate:
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Modular design with separate classes for Game, Pacman, Ghost, and Maze
- **Game Development Concepts**: Real-time gameplay, collision detection, AI behavior patterns
- **Python Programming**: Use of Pygame library for graphics and game mechanics
- **Software Design**: Clean code structure with configuration management and separation of concerns

### Technical Features Implemented

- **Smooth Movement System**: Grid-based movement with pixel-perfect positioning
- **AI Ghost Behavior**: Different ghost personalities (chase, scatter, random) with pathfinding
- **Collision Detection**: Efficient collision system for pellets, power pellets, and ghosts
- **Game State Management**: Menu, playing, paused, and game over states
- **Performance Optimization**: Frame rate control and efficient rendering

### Learning Outcomes

- Understanding of game loops and real-time programming
- Implementation of basic AI for game characters
- Experience with event handling and user input
- Knowledge of graphics programming and animation
- Problem-solving skills in game physics and collision detection
